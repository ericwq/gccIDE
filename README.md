# gccIDE

A neovim based GCC/G++ IDE, based on [alpine](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) linux, c/c++ language server enabled, syntax highlight IDE. Just pull docker image from [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/ericwq057/goccide) and run it.

For me [golangIDE](https://github.com/ericwq/golangIDE) is a good development environment for go language. I still need a c/c++ language development environment.

```sh
% docker pull ericwq057/gccide:latest

% docker run -it -d -h gccide  --env TZ=Asia/Shanghai  --name gcc \
  --mount source=proj-vol,target=/home/ide/proj \
  --mount type=bind,source=YOUR-SHARED-DIRECTORY,target=/home/ide/develop \
  gccide:latest

$ docker exec -u ide -it gcc bash
```

- `YOUR-SHARED-DIRECTORY` is you local source code directory shared with native OS. E.g. "/Users/qiwang/dev".
- You may need to create a docker volume `proj-vol` first:

```sh
% docker volume create proj-vol
```

- `proj-vol` is also your source code directory, which you don't need to access from native OS. It's faster comparing with shared one.

## Status

Waiting for the real project verification. Currently try to figure out how to perform [ccls](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls/wiki/Project-Setup#ccls-file) project setup. Try to verifiy it with the following projects:

- [grpc/grpc](https://github.com/grpc/grpc) c/c++ project.
- [martinezjavier/ldd3](https://github.com/martinezjavier/ldd3) c project.
- [linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) c project. I hope so.
