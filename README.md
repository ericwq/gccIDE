# gccIDE

A neovim based GCC/G++ IDE in the docker environment. Based on alpine.

For me [golangIDE](https://github.com/ericwq/golangIDE) is a good development environment for go language. I still need a c/c++ language development environment also.

Status: waiting for the real project verification.
